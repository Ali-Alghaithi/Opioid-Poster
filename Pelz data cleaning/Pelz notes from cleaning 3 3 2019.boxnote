The datasets I used are located in the 'Data' subfolder here. Most of them came from the foundation for AIDS research (amfar). One of the data sets came from the Kaiser Foundation.\n\nI cleaned and joined the different data sets to create to dataframes, one with state data and the other with county. We could in turn join these but I left them separate for now. I exported the first few rows of the dataframes to .csv files, which are in this folder, for easier inspection.\n\nThe markdown file in this folder should be ready for use and manipulation by the group. You'd just need to download the datasets to your wd and then change the appropriate line in the first chunk of the code. The r code here should be improved upon, and in fact it may have errors.\n\nSome notes on the data. In the 'countyDat' display, 'percentabusers12andolder' refers to the percent of the population 12 and older who use pain medication without a prescription. This data is only available for 2014, whereas the rest of the data runs from 2010-2017.\n\nIn the 'stateDat' display, the 'drug' columns has four groups: natural, synthetic, methadone, and heroin. This data came from the kaiser foundation. 'Natural' includes hydrocodone and oxycodone. 'Synthetic' includes fentanyl and tramadol. This data has drug-specific overdose deaths beginning in 1999. Other data in this display begins in 2010. There's a column for totaldeaths. These numbers don't seem to line up with the drug specific deaths, but there could be many reasons for that.\n\nIn addition to this, I have a couple datasets with global data. The fields are somewhat different from this national data. I'd like to look at those datasets as a group and decide what we want to use.\n\nNote From Ali:\nReading the data:\nYou only  change the working Directory inside  Code number 18\nknitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/Users/alialghaithi/Box Sync/Data Visualization Undergraduate Project/Pelz data cleaning/Data')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*8*9*5*b+a*8*9*b+4*8*9*5*b+1*8|2+2*4*5*6+5x|1+1*4|1+1*4*5*6+82*4|2+2*j*8*5*6+7t*4|2+2*4*5*6+7f*4|2+2*4*5*6+dj*4|2+2*4*5*6+5k*4|1+1*8|1+1*8*9*5*b+e*8*9*b|1+1*8*9*5*g+h*8*g|1+1*8*9*5*6+1p*8*6*c|1+1*8+x*8*f+2l*8|f+h|1+1","opCount":28,"appliedAttribsCount":62,"maxAttribsOnSingleOp":4},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.4fz9s4pIrvcRKF5l"],"1":["align","left"],"2":["insertorder","first"],"3":["lmkr","1"],"4":["author","6975314384"],"5":["font-color-000000","true"],"6":["font-size-medium","true"],"7":["removed","true"],"8":["author","869898444"],"9":["bold","true"],"10":["font-size-medium",""],"11":["font-size-verylarge","true"],"12":["font-size-small","true"],"13":["font-size-verylarge",""],"14":["font-size-small",""],"15":["font-color-ea1f43","true"],"16":["font-size-large","true"],"17":["strikethrough","true"],"18":["strikethrough",""],"19":["annotation-103dc5707c414681b11b3feb0dbab399","true"]},"nextNum":20},"chatHead":-1,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[]}
